# Chat_gpt_NextJs

### A project that requests with chat-gpt. 

this is an application made in NextJs that makes the request with the Chat-gpt api.
We implemented a responsive design and some functions that NextJs has.
Besides that I did this project to improve my skills as a Front-End developer.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Create a env:

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
